# Twitterposter
This project selects items at random from a provided data list that aligns with the desired niche or sector. It then uses that data to generate related content which it aims to use the Twitter/X API to post on the platform. It also uses the Google's API to obtain images from the web that are tied to the item and posts them on the platform.
